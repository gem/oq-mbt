Supported file formats
======================

The construction of an earthquake source model require a large amount of 
infomation of different characteristics such as for example earthquake 
catalogues or information about shallow active faults.

This information must be provided to the oq-mbt using one of the different 
file formats supported. 

Below we provide a short description of the various typologies of information
supported and the corresponding file formats. For specific information on 
shapefiles see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile

Area sources
------------
Area sources can be produced starting from the information included in a shapefile.

Catalogues
----------
The MBT can read standard `.csv` earthquake catalogue files supported by the 
Hazard Modeller's Toolkit (see the oq-hmtk for additional information).

Shallow Faults
--------------

The construction of fault sources with the oq-mbt starts from the information
included in a shapefile  

Strain rate
-----------

Strain rate models can be used for the characterisation of earthquake 
occurrence in the oq-mbt.
